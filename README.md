# My Portfolio

## Why?

-   I recognized my need for a portfolio site a while ago, however, up until recently, the process of creating projects without a tutorial seemed quite daunting because of my fear for unsolvable errors. The reality is, however, no error is truly unsolvable, you just haven't found a way to solve it, and sometimes that involves making a solution. (thats what makes us engineers! That's also why I'm starting my [#GettingCrackedAtC]("https://github.com/izzyzs/Learning_C_2.0") journey: C forces you to create everything from the most primitive types)

## Tech Stack

So far, my tech stack is as follows:

1. React.js & Next.js with Typescript
2. Tailwind
3. getform.io (for contact me form submission)

-   **_Note_**: Im not sure if I'll really need anything more, but that will depend on how far I take the project. I just wanted to create something really barebones to start with, and just deploy.

## Notable Moments

-   _December 25, 2024_: I struggled with starting my project with Bootstrap (I wanted to use it in attempt to avoid frontend difficulty; decided against it to develop my skill) and eventually realized the problem was I was trying to use Tailwind and Bootstrap together ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Once I figured that out, I recreated the project in Bootstrap, I realized I didn't like the container system because I had gotten used to using css flex or css grid (Bootstrap's col-row system uses flex) and why not flex my css muscle? So I decided on just sticking with Tailwind. _(Written 12/26/2024)_
